# Spring/Java Rest Api Angular8 Uploadfile

Create a simple web project, that provides a form to upload a file and gather some metadata for that file: Title, Description and Creation date

The UI can be implemented in any SPA framework of your choice.
The REST back-end will be preferably implemented based on Java/Spring Boot (+ any Spring/Java library/framework of your choice) to store data.
No user authentication and security features are needed.
Project can use simple in-memory DB to store data
Files can be stored in web server file system.
No need to implement routing or sophisticated state management in UI (e.g. FLUX)
Project can use any quality assurance mechanisms or build tools of choice
You may also submit with the project any design considerations, restrictions, or possible future enhancements (if applicable)
There's no need to setup a live demo. You can either choose to commit your code on a public Github repository, or share the project privately, it's up to you, as long as we get to run the project and read the code ourselves.
